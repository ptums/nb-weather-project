# Project Your Experience app

- Request form to build features.
- I build it and it becomes a part of the app.
  -- UI: thin sidebar dots for each app so they can switch over easily, default apps (like the browser - new install - prompted "would u like to make it the default?")
- A personalized custom single-use app store
  -- I want a "tree builder" app
  --And other ideas
